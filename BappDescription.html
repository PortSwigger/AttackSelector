<p>This extension lets you configure multiple scan profiles, such as "XSS only" or "Quick scan".
When sending items to be scanned, you can select which profile to use from the context menu.</p>

<p>The plugin will automatically manage the new queue and run scans with the different configuration.</p>

<p><b>Please note that when using this plugin you should NOT use the normal active scanner nor modify Burp scanning configuration.</b></p>
